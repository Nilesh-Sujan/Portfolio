# Nilesh Sujan's Coding Projects
Welcome to my coding playground! ðŸ‘‹ This repository showcases a diverse collection of projects spanning various programming languages, including Java, Python, and LUA. My primary focus revolves around creating projects in LUA, particularly within the dynamic and engaging world of ROBLOX.

## About the Repository
In this repository, you'll find a range of projects that reflect my journey in software development. What sets this collection apart is the emphasis on LUA, as I believe in building projects that directly engage end-users, especially on platforms like ROBLOX.

## Why LUA?
While I enjoy exploring and coding in languages like Python and Java, I find a unique satisfaction in creating interactive and immersive experiences on ROBLOX. Instead of just sharing code snippets, I strive to develop projects that users can directly experience and enjoy. I would therefore say LUA/Python are my strongest language, having almost 5 years experience coding in both. As LUA is very similar to Python, the skills I learnt in one language are easily transferable to the other.

Feel free to explore the projects, provide feedback, and join me on this coding adventure!
